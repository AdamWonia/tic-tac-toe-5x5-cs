# Tic Tac Toe 5x5

This repository contains the game Tic Tac Toe made in C# using Windows Forms. The game has a board with dimensions of 5x5 fields. To win you need to arrange 4 of the same symbols in one line.

## Launch

To run the program, you can open the project using the Visual Studio IDE and just click the Run button or go to the *TicTacToe\bin\Debug* folder, where there is a **TicTacToe.exe** file that you can run directly.

## How to play

There are two buttons in the main window. The first is **START BUTTON**, which must be clicked to start the game. The second button is the **RESTART BUTTON**, which restarts the game. This means that all points scored by players are reset to zero and the board is cleared. 

To win you must have 4 specific characters on one line. When you win, your points increase by one.

I hope you enjoy the game.
